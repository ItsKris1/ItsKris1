### Welcome to my portfolio! ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior developer, who specializes in front-end development. I have strong fundamentals in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I have worked with JavaScript frameworks React and Vue. 

I have also worked with Figma, since I can focus on the design only and then put that into code instead of doing two things at once.

Although I specialize in front-end development, this doesn't mean that I don't know anything about the back-end side of development. For example in my Forum project I built back-end by myself and in Social-Network I had to be up to date with the back-end since building new features didn't happen without one another.
