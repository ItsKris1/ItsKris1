### Welcome to my portfolio! ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior developer, who specializes in front-end development. I have strong fundamentals in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I have worked with JavaScript frameworks React and Vue. 

I have also worked with Figma, since I can focus on the design only and then put that into code instead of doing two things at once.

Although I specialize in front-end development, this doesn't mean that I don't know anything about the other world of development. I've always been the person who wants to understand the bigger picture so I am open to try new things!
