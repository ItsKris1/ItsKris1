### Welcome to my portfolio! ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior developer, who specializes in front-end development. I have strong fundamentals in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I have worked with JavaScript frameworks React and Vue. Addition to that I have used Figma to create design for my projects.

I may specialize in front-end development but this doesn't mean I am not open to another possibilites. I find IT as a field very interesting. I am motivated and ready to learn more.
