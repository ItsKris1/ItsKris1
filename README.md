### Welcome to my portfolio! ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior developer, who specializes in front-end development. I have strong fundamentals in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I have worked with JavaScript frameworks React and Vue. Addition to that I have used Figma to focus on design and HTML & CSS separately.

I may know front-end technologies the best but this doesn't mean I don't know anything about the back-end side. I created the back-end by myself in the Forum project and Social-Network required working closely with the back-end team to deliver new features.
